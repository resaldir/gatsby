My name is Resaldi Ramadhan Putra, but you can call me Saldi. I’m a developer, designer, writer, and also a student from Sukabumi but lived in Jakarta Selatan. I currently work as a sysadmin, storage admin, and database admin for [Protonema](https://www.protonema.co.id/) and [Telkomsel](https://telkomsel.com/). I also write for [Microsoft Lovers](https://www.facebook.com/OnMSL/) and [medium](/publications).

I started this website as a place to document everything I learned. I’ve continued throughout my career and the free resources I create help thousands of people successfully become developers, and share a bit of myself with the world. Building simple things for complex interfaces is what I enjoy most about my work. I am also interested in exploring new worlds. Please consider [supporting me with a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/saldiwe).
